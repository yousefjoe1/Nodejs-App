# Nodejs-App
# To make the app work do next:
- In your terminal: npm run start. Now your server run on port 3000. Go to: http://localhost:3000/
- I provided five images in to test the app: 1-Moon 2-nature 3-animal 4-relaxing 5-wave .
- To resize the image, go to : http://localhost:3000/api/images/?filename=write image name here&width=the needed width&height=the needed height. Then press Enter
- The image formt is just jpg so, write the image name without the format and for your notes, any other image format will not work.
# availble scripts:
- For test => npm run test
- For build => npm run build
- To start the app => npm run start
